I'm a passionate Cybersecurity student and aspire to become a full-time penetration tester as soon as I'm done with my studies.   
I joined the infosec community in early 2020 and haven't stopped hacking (ethically) ever since.  

I'm currently focusing on web application security, hunting for bugs in Bug Bounty platforms.  

> This is my personal website where I keep the writeups for various challanges, machines and/labs I solved. I'll soon start publishing blog posts covering some useful topics and bug bounty findings.
